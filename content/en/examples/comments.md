In Cairo programs, any text after a pair of forward slashes (`//`) and until the end of the line will be ignored by the compiler.

You can use this to leave explanatory comments in your code.

```rust {.codebox}
fn main() -> felt252 {
    // start of the function
    1 + 4 // return the sum of 1 and 4
}
```
