The basic data type in Cairo is `felt252`, which stands for *field element*.
These are integers in the range `0 <= x < P`, where `P` is a large prime number, currently equatl to `P = 2^{251} + 17 * 2^{192}+1`.
Field elements have the property of *turning around* when their value falls outside the specified range.

```rust {.codebox}
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let x: felt252 = 2;
    let y: felt252 = 5;
    (x + y).print();
}
```

Since `felt252` is the default data type, in simple cases like these there is no real need to specify the type.
This means we can simply write:

```rust {.codebox}
use debug::PrintTrait;

fn main() {
    let x = 2;
    let y = 5;
    (x + y).print();
}
```
